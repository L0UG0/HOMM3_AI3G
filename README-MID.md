## ABOUT
I’ve started doing research on map generation for HoMM3, and the initial commits will come in this week — I’m focusing on a deterministic, seed-based pipeline (heightmaps, biomes, hydrology), core placement rules for resources, towns, and neutral objects, and a lot of exploratory work around studying existing HoMM3 maps, community tools, reverse-engineering formats and gameplay constraints, digging through docs, forums, and old generators, and comparing different algorithmic approaches to understand what works well and what breaks balance before moving forward.
